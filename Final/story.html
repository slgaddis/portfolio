                <p>The story of Elden Ring revolves around the mysterious Elden Ring, a powerful artifact that governed the natural order of the world. Once shattered, the Elden Ring caused the downfall of the land of the Lands Between and left it in a state of chaos. The Elden Ring’s shattering shattered the bond between the gods, kings, and the world’s creatures, ushering in an era of darkness and instability.</p>
