            The gameplay of *Elden Ring* builds upon the foundations set by FromSoftware's previous titles, such as *Dark Souls* and *Bloodborne*, with a unique twist. Players engage in challenging combat with both swordplay and magic, and the inclusion of mounted combat adds a new dynamic to the battles. Each encounter is meticulously designed to test the player's skill and patience, rewarding precision and strategy.

            A standout feature of the game is the ability to customize the protagonist's build. Players can invest in various attributes, including strength, dexterity, intelligence, and faith, which directly affect combat and abilities. This system allows for a personalized playstyle, whether you prefer heavy weapons, magic spells, or stealthy tactics. Additionally, a robust selection of weapons, armor, and items ensures that players can experiment with their approach.

            Multiplayer in *Elden Ring* expands the experience by allowing players to team up with others for cooperative play or engage in competitive duels. The multiplayer system encourages interaction in the form of summoning allies for tough boss battles or invading others' worlds to engage in combat. This adds a layer of unpredictability and excitement to the game, as players can befriend or challenge others in the vast world of the Lands Between.
